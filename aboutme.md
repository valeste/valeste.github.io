### Current Research 

As a graduate student and research assistant, my research focuses on using genomic techniques and environmental data to better understand how corals respond to changing ecological conditions. My work is housed within the Roberts Lab at the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Science as a part of the NSF funded e5 Coral project.
