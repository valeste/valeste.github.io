### Current Research 

My current research is focused on identifying the constraints on in vitro cellular immortality in a marine model invertebrate, Botryllus schlosseri. This process will involve the optimization of primary cell culture conditions to promote the genetic diversity that will facilitate spontaneous or induced immortalization. My research work is conducted in the [Gardell Lab](https://gardell.ds.lib.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington, Tacoma as a part of the NSF funded project: Somatic cell adaptation towards immortalization in a marine tunicate. 


### Background
I graduated from the University of California, Davis in 2020 with a bachelor of science in Animal Biology where I completed a capstone project in the [Connon Lab](https://connonlab.wordpress.com/) exploring the impacts of bifenthrin, a commonly employed insecticide, on the development and behavior of the endangered Delta Smelt. Upon graduating I continued my research work in the Connon Lab for an additional two years working across various projects investigating the effects of contaminant, pathogenic, thermal, and salinity stressors on native California vertebrate species.
