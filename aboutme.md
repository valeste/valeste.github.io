### Current Research 

My current work focuses on Alaskan populations of snow and Tanner crab (*Chionoecetes bairdi* and *C. opilio*), and their parasite *Hematodinium sp.*. *Hematodinium* is a globally-distributed dinoflagellate notorious for damaging crustacean fisheries and aquaculture. In *Chionoecetes*, it manifests as BCS (Bitter Crab Syndrome), which turns the crab flesh chalky and astringent.

I'm investigating the relationship between *Hematodinium* and *Chionoecetes*, along with the response of this system to climate change. To do so, I use both transcriptomics and generalized linear models.

### Background

Prior to joining the Roberts lab, I worked on snow and Tanner crab research with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. While there, I assisted with crab fecundity studies, fishery sampling, and surveys of Bering Sea crab populations. I also joined some non-crab-related projects, including sampling deliveries of groundfish and monitoring salmon runs. I have also worked with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife on herring spawn events and ichthyoplankton distribution.

While at undergrad, I researched genetic links to thermal tolerance in the invasive European green crab (*Carcinus maenas*). This project examined the East Coast population of this globally-distributed invader, and found a link between mitochondrial haplotype and cold tolerance. 

In my free time, I love long-distance cycling, mixing cocktails, and making candy!
