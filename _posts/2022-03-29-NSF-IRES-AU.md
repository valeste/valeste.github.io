### No longer doing this, great lesson in figuring out credit budgeting before applying for things like this

I got into the upcoming [NSF IRES Australia](https://www.ires-au.com/) program focucing on transdisciplinary coral reef science.

### Reminders

* Course is May 9 - August 14, remote and once a week except for the field portion
* Field portion in Australia is May 30 - June 20

### To-do

* Figure out credit funding, each credit is 1444, so for 6 credits the total is 8664
* Get enrolled at NSU
