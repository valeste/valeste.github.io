## Speeding Things Up

As of my last post (yesterday), I was trying to figure out a way to rapidly obtain large numbers of GO IDs. Last time, I used [Sam's shell script](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/blob/master/script-box/uniprot2go.sh) by calling it inside a Jupyter notebook. However, Sam's script took an extremely long time to run. A rough ballpark: for my 2 analyses (each with ~120,000 accession IDs), it would take a total of about 8 days on my local machine. That's a huge pipeline bottleneck, and so we found an alternative.

## New Script for Uniprot to GO

I created [an R script](https://github.com/afcoyle/hemat_bairdi_transcriptome/blob/main/scripts/1_3_uniprot_to_GO.Rmd) for obtaining GO terms from accession IDs. Downside: it requires you to manually download the SwissProt database - with all GO terms included - from https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/. Upside: it's much, much, much faster. It ran in a few minutes, which by my calculation, is a bit faster than 8 days.

After getting GO terms, you need to remove duplicate lines prior to inputting to GO-MWU. So after using the R script (if you choose that path), switch over to [the other script](https://github.com/afcoyle/hemat_bairdi_transcriptome/blob/main/scripts/1_4_eliminate_duplicates.ipynb) and begin running the analyses. 

Using Sam's shell script is probably still preferable if you're looking at small numbers of genes or have a really fast internet connection. Otherwise, the new R script is likely preferable.

## Running GO-MWU

Once I got past that bottleneck, I ran [GO-MWU](https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU) on my two analyses. 

Reminder of what those analyses consisted of:

1. Elevated Day 2 individual libraries vs. Ambient Day 0+2 individual libraries

2. Ambient Day 0+2+17 libraries + Elevated Day 0 libraries + Lowered Day 0 libraries vs. Elevated Day 2 libraries. Reminder: Day 0 samples were taken while all crabs were still held at ambient temperatures.

Here are my results for each comparison:

**Elevated Day 2 vs. Ambient Day 0+2, individual libraries**

- Red = up-regulated, blue = down-regulated (up-regulated = higher at elevated)
- Fraction: number of "good candidates" relative to total num of genes in category. A "good gene" is one with an unadjusted p-value <0.05.

## Quick Conclusions:

It sure looks like the first comparison gave more meaningful results than the second comparison. This could be because we sampled the same crabs in both groups (e.g. a sample of Crab G on Day 0 is part of the Amb Day 0/2/17 + Elev Day 0 + Low Day 0 group, a sample of Crab G on Day 2 is part of the Elevated Day 2 group).

It might be worth redoing this latter analysis with the Elevated Day 0 crabs dropped from the ambient treatment group altogether. Alternately, it may be neat to look at Elevated Day 0 vs. Elevated Day 2 - essentially, a pure examination of the effects of temperature on the same crab
