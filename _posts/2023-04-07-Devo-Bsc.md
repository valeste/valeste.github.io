Text written in black on image was provided directly through [Kowarsky et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108681). Figure is modified with superimposed red text A1-D/TO to match the alternative staging nomenclature utilized in UWT lab. There are several competing staging schemes available for *Botryllus schlosseri*  including the alternative Sabbadin method utilized in [Campagna et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-2598-1).
