### Figure from [Kowarsky et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108681)

Text written in black on image was provided directly through [Kowarsky et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108681). Figure is modified with superimposed red text A1-D/TO to match the alternative staging nomenclature utilized in UWT lab. There are several competing staging schemes available for *Botryllus schlosseri*  including the alternative Sabbadin method utilized in [Campagna et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-2598-1). The associated staging ID's for the Sabbadin method have been superimposed in blue text. 

Below is a table that more clearly defines each stage from [Manni et al.,2006](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.21037).
