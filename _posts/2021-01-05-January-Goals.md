Summary of Monthly Goals:
- Collect more tunicates and maintain them in recirculating seawater system
- Continue troubleshooting through primary cell culture protocol with Valerie (UCD)
- Decide on a chemical mutagen to use for colony exposures
- Get an experimental design draft completed for the in vivo colony exposures


### Collecting more _Botryllus schlosseri_
Before leaving for the winter break, the Gardell Lab reduce the number of colonies kept in the recirculating seawater system. As such, before getting started on colony exposures or working through cell culturing, we will need to re-establish a colony stock in house. I plan to collect more colonies (number TBD) from the De Moines Marina. I want to incorporate dipping colonies in Coral Rx upon arrival to UW Tacoma to improve survival.

Ideally the colonies used for exposures and cell culturing are lab grown but it is still not know if colonies are not proliferative in our lab conditions due to the season or some other constraint.

### Troubleshooting primary cell culture protocol
