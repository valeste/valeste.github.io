Happy new years! This is my first lab notebook entry. Since I am now starting the second quarter of my graduate program, I will be summarizing my research activities from the previous quarter. 

### Drafting Protocol for Primary Cell Cultures

As I was unfamiliar with the practice of primary cell culturing I began the process with reviewing basic cell culture techniques from the textbook titled Culture of Animal Cells by R. Ian Freshney (5th Edition). After, I began combing through the document "NSF proposal grant references" in the Joint NSF Tunicate Google Drive to become up to date with the latest methods in culturing _B. schlosseri_ epithelial cells. I found _Epithelial cell cultures from Botryllus schlosseri palleal buds: accomplishments and challenges_, 2003 by (Rabinowitz & Rinkevich)[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11022-004-2087-9] particularly useful. Collaborating with Valerie Dong from the UC Davis lab, we began drafting the Rabinowitz & Rinkevich 2003 methods into a standard operation procedure that would become applicable to Aim 1 of the NSF proposal, Optimization of primary cultures of _B. schlosseri_. This protocol is still a work in progress and will need the addition of methodologies for blood cell isolation.
