Itâ€™s the start of a new quarter today! Goals for the rest of the month
include:

1.  Trial run epithelial cell extraction of snail tissue.
2.  Check on the population of tunicates at the De Moines marina. Last
    we checked, there were limited numbers of tunicates (almost none). I
    believe none were found for the *in vivo* exposures. Ideally, with
    the warming temperatures, the pop has bounced back.
