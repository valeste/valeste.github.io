## Week 02 of the Spring 2023 Quarter Summary

This week primarily involved maintenance and further collection of wild colonies of *Botryllus schlosseri*. This has involved the refinement of the [intake protocol](https://valeste.github.io/2023-03-31-Week-01/).

Also, I have incorporated maintenance of oozooid individuals that had been in our lab but not growing since November 2022. I assume the lack of growth is a result of zero water changes, no cleaning of the glass slides, and sparse feeding.

For both wild colonies and oozoid individuals, I created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yc1-GUQrZSsnayFffopUN5eGBaB0N31WvYhn_J3RDxE/edit?usp=sharing) with information relevant to the colonies growth and stages. 

The aim of monitoring growth and development is to quantitatively determine time of termination due to health factors, identify the lag time between intake to a large enough healthy colony that can be sacrificed for cell culture, and maintain a log of all colonies brought in from different locations to identify which populations may do better in our recirculating artificial seawater system.
