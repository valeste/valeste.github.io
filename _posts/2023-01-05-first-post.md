Happy new years! This is my first lab notebook entry. Since I am now starting the second quarter of my graduate program, I will be summarizing my research activities from the previous quarter. 

### Drafting Protocol for Primary Cell Cultures

Before I could begin 

### Visiting Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station

Given my background in remote sensing, I'm interested to see if any Earth observations data might be useful in the modelling efforts of the E5 project. I am familiar with datasets and algorithms used to estimate various water quality parameters, like chlorophyll-a, turbidity, suspended sediment concentration, CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter), and SST (sea surface temperature). I am particularly interested in harnessing the higher resolution of the [Landsat Series](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat) and the [Sentinel Missions](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions#:~:text=The%20main%20objective%20of%20the,the%20Plesetsk%20cosmodrome%20in%20Russia.) to provide data products at 10m-30m resolution.

I'm currently in the process of assessing the remote sensing resources compiled by the Moorea Coral Reef LTER. I'm also in communication with colleagues from my previous place of work, NASA DEVELOP, about a tool created during their Fall 2019 term. The [ORCAA tool](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2019/fall/BelizeHondurasWaterII.html) is a good base for assessing water quality parameters via remote sensing in Google Earth Engine. The tool needs some updating and could be spruced up with more complex analysis, so I am hoping to stay involved with development to improve access to relevant data products.

### Practicing the workflow of primary cell culturing
