Today I graded pre-labs for my lab sections in FISH 270.

I also started going through the following paper, Cai and Zhang, “Marine Invertebrate Cell Culture.”, that describes the methods attempted thus far in establishing primary cultures of marine invertebrates.

Things that stood out to me that I would like to include in my own methods was the inclusion of Retinoic Acid to promote cell proliferation and the use of a disk diffusion assay to determine the most effective combination of antibiotics to use on the different cell types (epithelial and hemolymph) we plan to use in the culturing methods.
