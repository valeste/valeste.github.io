## Goals
* Complete lncRNA ID retrieval from ceabigr data.
* Complete differential expression analysis of lncRNAs between ceabigr treatment groups (OA vs control).
* Create circos plots for ceabigr lncRNA data.
* Look for areas in the C. virginica genome where lncRNAs may interact (BLAST lncRNA data against genome). Potentially getting at something similar to [this study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10126-022-10140-0) but with OA.
* Run hisat for lncRNA identification of Express_Compare coral data
* Design new primers for [mussel heat stress experiments](https://github.com/afcoyle/fish541_lab) we did in class. Focus more specifically on heat stress indicators in Mytilus trossulus and edulis.
* Confirm whether or not I got FISH 250 (Marine Biology) TA postion (should hear back by Aug 15th).
