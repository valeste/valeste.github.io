Today I TA'ed my first lab session for FISH 270. The experience went rather well and I learned how to help students structure smaller scale expirements like those done in this course. I also attended my FISH 549 course: Best practices in environmental data science. We were presented with some basic functions offered on GitHub such as creating projects, issues, and new repositories.
