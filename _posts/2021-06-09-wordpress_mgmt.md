## I'll keep this quick

It's my third lab notebook post of the day, so definitely want to be brief with all this! But basically, I'm taking over the [Bitter Crab blog](https://bittercrab.wordpress.com/) from Grace! I've got a bunch of vague ideas for where to go from here, with the goal of keeping it generally outreach-y rather than getting too tied up in what's happening in the lab. After all, if people want that, they can just come here!

I also already wrote my first blog post - on snow and Tanner crab hybridization!

Anyways, this is largely to mark that a) I'm managing the blog now, and b) to just put down some ideas I had for future articles to write. They're generally Tanner- or Hematodinium-centric, but branch out a bit into some other Alaskan crab fisheries. They are as follows:

- Tanner crab fisheries (Bering Sea, Kodiak, SE)
- Tanner crab mating behavior
- _Chionoecetes_ species in the north Pacific
- History of Tanner crab as a resource
- Tanner crab processing
- History of _Hematodinium_
- Traditional methods of catching Alaskan crabs
- _Hematodinium_ distribution and speciation
- Description of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab survey
- Other fisheries impacted by _Hematodinium_
- General overview of some other Alaskan crab fisheries
- Rhizocephalan barnacles
- Black mat disease
- The NOAA trawl survey and its history
- Snow crab north of the Bering Strait
- Rickettsia-like organisms and potential emerging diseases
- Tanner crabs and molting
- What is a "true crab"
- Red Queen hypothesis

I might also expand it a bit to some other fun marine resource things!
- Long Island Sound lobster fishery collapse
- Green crab invasion history
- Salmon weirs
