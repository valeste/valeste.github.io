Designing heat stress specific primers for Mytilus trossulus/edulis…

Previous primers used in class lab were from this paper: [DNA Damage and Transcriptional Changes in the Gills of Mytilus galloprovincialis Exposed to Nanomolar Doses of Combined Metal Salts (Cd, Cu, Hg)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054602#pone.0054602-Livak1)

Primers might not have been appropriate for heat stress since the study was directed more toward metal toxicity. The mussel species may have also been too dissimilar from those we used (primers were for galloprovincialis rather than trossulus or edulis).

Currently looking at [this](https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/cob/content_public/journal/jeb/213/20/10.1242_jeb.046094/3/3548.pdf?Expires=1662675798&Signature=yRo3Amp2FmeLdu6th0ysrMrBJO3ai3txBJOVHYyQOf41WC-082GbJnwM7gogrwiXX-S9WbqCzYV3NtWoVsghPmwnFQ0Crr4tzIHZKdlWp-4bqv5JxcMsl004fh9A2St3kfLDusO9ilkQV~1UjfCshuQMTwyptW0cLuWVywDa~LbBKfPZruEA~AXr0S9AZuT5-XCsKH-pabvUXERTaXoNcpnFNvtM3ewkOP3jY~uJhmcu1mWN8TlN-eC-Pzj00FPb-K9pzOB~OGSNKTEz1rqZM8pAD8Um5XID2PBhFrm3gjhAPELVvLBvHh6l8qIALNO-hHMLnT5MTDwEMaYfWVrrDg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) publication comparing differences in expression after acute heat stress between galloprovincialis and trossulus. Seems like some common players are the same between the two, like Hsp70s, Hsp90, Hsp60, DnaJ and chaperonin TCP1.

Need to look a little closer at some of the figures to get species specific genes that saw up-regulation in trossulus and continue lit review.
