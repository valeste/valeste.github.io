This is my first daily post of the quarter. I think this may be a useful way of keeping accountable and reflecting on the smaller increments of progress completed day by day. Today was my first day back at the Tacoma campus for Winter Quarter 23'. I worked on getting the Gardell Lab website spruced up, working on a schematic for colony exposures with benzene[a]pyrene, organizing my library in Zotero, and finishing up the slides and Google Drive folders that will be needed for Aidan and I's first lab sessions this week. I also finally added my bio and linked my lab notebook to the Roberts Lab website!
