# Tunicate culture media (TCM) forulations
Formulated two versions of tunicate culture media (TCM) to evaluate whether it would be better to use a higher dose of antibiotics relative to what is described in 

[Version 1 TCM](https://valeste.github.io/2023-04-25-wt-epi-cell-protocol/)
This version of TCM follows the instructions in the linked notebook post. Contains the following ratios of solution:

- 63.5% L-15 media
- 30.2% concentrated filtered seawater (FSW)
- 3.3% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
- 1.4% HEPES (20 mMol/L stock)
- 1.4% Penicillin-Streptomycin (100x stock)
- 0.1% Amphotericin B (250 ug/mL stock)

[Version 2 TCM](https://valeste.github.io/2023-04-11-epi-cell-protocol/)

This version of TCM follows the instructions of it's linked post with the following ratios of solutions:

- 63.8% L-15 media
- 30.5% concentrated filtered seawater (FSW)
- 3.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
- 1.4% HEPES  (20 mMol/L stock)
- 0.7% Penicillin-Streptomycin (100x stock)
- 0.07% Amphotericin B (250 ug/mL stock)

# Colony information

I dissected buds from two colonies collected on 4/20/23.

# Overview of dissection workflow

The overall protocol followed can be viewed in the [this](https://valeste.github.io/2023-04-25-wt-epi-cell-protocol/) notebook post.

Most notably:
1. Colonies were kept in ASW-G (0.05% gentamicin) for 21 hours prior to dissection. 
2. ASW-PSA the solution was reduced to 0.1% Amp B & 1% Pen-Strep as described in that notebook post.
3. Colonies were not tied to glass slide or substrate during the dissection process but were instead free floating in the ASW-PSA dissection solution.
  
# Schematics

![Plate 2](https://github.com/valeste/valeste.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/Schematics/20230425_1.jpg?raw=true)

![Plate 1](https://github.com/valeste/valeste.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/Schematics/20230425_2.jpg?raw=true)

Here the blue color coded buds in wells 1-3 of both plate 1 and 2 are from colony DM20230420_01, whereas the orange color coded buds are from colony DM20230420_02. Plate 1 contains the "lower" dosage of antibiotics while Plate 2 contains the "higher" dosage. Furthermore, for colony DM20230420_01, wells were seeded with twice as much tissue to see if tissue density had an effect on the growth rate of epithelial cells.

# Imaged tissue 04-21-2023 
In order to get a reference of the tissue prior to cell growth I took a few example images.

# Imaged tissue 04-24-2023
Three days after seeding the tissue, cell growth and contamination were qualitatively evaluated using the Evos XL Core inverted microscope. 

Most notably:
- All wells from plate 1, with the lower dosage of antibiotics all had an unidentifiable but relatively dense distribution of spherical green clumps of cells. Plate 2 appears to have these clumps as well but a much lower frequency.
