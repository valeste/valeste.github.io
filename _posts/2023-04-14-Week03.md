## Week 03 of the Spring 2023 Quarter Summary
The colonies gathered from the previous two weeks of the quarter have not showed significant signs of adapting to the recirculating seawater system at UWT. As such, I have developed an alternative protocol that will involve the isolation of epithelial tissue directly from colonies immediately removed from the field. This protocol will be carried out for the first time on 04-17-2023.
