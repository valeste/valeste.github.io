Today I completed my homework 1 for FISH 521. This involved reading a focal paper in our field and analyzing the methods of communication. The practice of reading like this facilitates the ability to become better writers and scientific communicators. 

In brief, the focal paper I selected  discussed the increase in _Piwi_ protein expression as the epithelial cells sourced from excised zooids of _Botryllus schlosseri_ proliferated over the course of 8 days. _Piwi_ is associated with self-renweal and maintenance of somatic and germ cells and as such is understood to be a marker of stemness.

I really enjoyed this exercise as some of the tasks also involved finding papers that the focal paper cited as well as those that cited the focal paper. Doing this in a sense is a great way to orient yourself in the forward direction of your fields research.

I used Zotero for this exercise and found the ability to add tags as a great way to quickly bin concepts together.
