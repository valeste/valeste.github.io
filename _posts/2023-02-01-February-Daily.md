### Feb 01, 2023
Today I met with Alison to present a proposed idea of my preliminary experimental design for testing out the effects of different basal culture medias on the longevity and proliferation of primary cell culture. I initially proposed 11 media and 2 substrates for a total of 22 conditions but was advised to slim it down to 4 media types for now. I also met with collaborators in the Kueltz Lab at UC Davis. We primarily discussed the broader impact goals we are setting for this quarter and went over in vivo colony exposures to nickle chloride.

Today I added all the supplies I need for preliminary step 0.1 (where I initiate primary cultures without manipulation of conditions) to the lab order list. I also scheduled a training with Dr. Julie Masura (UW Tacoma) to be trained on using her lab's phase contrast microscope for next Tuesday.

### Feb 03, 2023
Today I continued working on my introduction research proposal draft. I also went to observe a course for my C ENV 555 course to take note on the methods of active learning employed in the classroom. I also TA'ed my lab section.

### Feb 04, 2023
I am spending today reading up on reviews of marine invertebrate cell culture, finishing my draft for the intro to my research proposal, completing my assignment for FISH 549, and ideally, if there is time, begin grading the pre-lab's for my TA section.

### Feb 05, 2023
Completed some assignments for my courses and graded pre-lab assignments.
