### Feb 01, 2023
Today I met with Alison to present a proposed idea of my preliminary experimental design for testing out the effects of different basal culture medias on the longevity and proliferation of primary cell culture. I initially proposed 11 media and 2 substrates for a total of 22 conditions but was advised to slim it down to 4 media types for now. I also met with collaborators in the Kueltz Lab at UC Davis. We primarily discussed the broader impact goals we are setting for this quarter and went over in vivo colony exposures to nickle chloride.

Today I added all the supplies I need for preliminary step 0.1 (where I initiate primary cultures without manipulation of conditions) to the lab order list. I also scheduled a training with Dr. Julie Masura (UW Tacoma) to be trained on using her lab's phase contrast microscope for next Tuesday.

### Feb 03, 2023
Today I continued working on my introduction research proposal draft. I also went to observe a course for my C ENV 555 course to take note on the methods of active learning employed in the classroom. I also TA'ed my lab section.

### Feb 04, 2023
I am spending today reading up on reviews of marine invertebrate cell culture, finishing my draft for the intro to my research proposal, completing my assignment for FISH 549, and ideally, if there is time, begin grading the pre-lab's for my TA section.

### Feb 05, 2023
Completed some assignments for my courses and graded pre-lab assignments.

### Feb 06, 2023
Today I went to my all three of my classes. I learned about different aspects of metadata, the process of looking for journals to publish in and writing cover letters for publication submissions, and reflected with my peers on our course observation assignments by specifically detailing the methods of active learning employed in those courses we observed. 

### Feb 07, 2023
Much of my day was spent prepping for this weeks FISH 270 labs. This involved figuring out how to train students on instruments like a pH meter, DO meter, hemocytometer, and fluorometer. I also met with Dr. Julie Masura, UWT, to be trained in the basics of phase contrast microscopy. The Olympus B202 fluorescence microscope will likely used down the line when fixing cells to investigate cell morphology and structure. I also met with the Gardell Lab to discuss plans for the lab website, including additional features that need to be further developed.

### Feb 08-17, 2023
As my TA'ing responsibilities doubled over the course of these two weeks, my research activities have been somewhat limited. I was however assigned the responsibility of revamping the Gardell Lab website so that it was up to date with all our ongoing research activities by the end of the month. So far I have made major changes to the webpages format, peoples page, and research page to reflect info that I have readily available.
