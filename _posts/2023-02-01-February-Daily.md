### Feb 01, 2023
Today I met with Alison to present a proposed idea of my preliminary expiremental design for testing out the effects of different basal culture medias on the longevity and proliferation of primary cell culture. I intially proposed 11 media and 2 substrates for a total of 22 conditions but was advised to slim it down to 4 media types for now. I also met with collaborators in the Kueltz Lab at UC Davis. We primarily discussed the broader impact goals we are setting for this quarter and went over in vivo colony exposures to nickle chloride.
