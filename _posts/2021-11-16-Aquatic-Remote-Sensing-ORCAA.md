### Using the Google Earth Engine platform to load, process, analyze, and visualize remote sensing data

Prior to joining the Roberts Lab this Fall, I worked for NASA Earth Applied Sciencesâ€™ [DEVELOP]( https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/) and [ARSET]( https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building/arset) programs. During this time, I became familiar a variety of environmental remote sensing techniques and platforms. One of the easiest ways to work with remote sensing data is Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE is a cloud-based raster computing platforms that uses a JavaScript API to manipulate remote sensing data. A variety of satellite images and data products are hosted through GEE (including Landsat and Sentinel imagery). This negates data storage issues and local machine computing limits. If you would like to learn more about GEE in general, please refer to [this training]( https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-using-google-earth-engine-land-monitoring-applications) I gave in June.

### Aquatic environmental parameter assessment and using the ORCAA tool

For the purposes of coral reef ecology, satellite remote sensing has the potential to expand spatial and temporal coverage of parameters such as chlorophyll, turbidity, SST, and CDOM. Public satellite technology made available by government agencies (namely NASA and ESA) can provide data at a 10m-30m resolution. Temporal resolution varies between sensors, but using data from more than one satellite sensor can provide multiple images per month.
