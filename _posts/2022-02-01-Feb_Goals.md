Here is a tentative list of goals for the month of February:

* Transfer _P. lutea_ and _P. verrucosa_ data files to Gannet and display genome annotation session in IGV with linked data.

* Finish metadata summary for preliminary genome data assessment.

* Familiarize myself with the Putnam Lab [Express_Compare](https://github.com/hputnam/Express_Compare) repository and figure out how to use [LncPipe](https://nf-co.re/lncpipe) to identufy long noncoding RNA molecules.

* Meet with [Stephane Maritorena](http://mcr.lternet.edu/people/stephane-maritorena) to get a better idea of current MCR remote sensing data archives.

* Work through machine learning methods shared in lab meetings to figure out whether or not they would be feasible for use in my work.

*Start posting weekly reviews of papers relevant to my interests and (at the very least) biweekly lab notebook updates.
