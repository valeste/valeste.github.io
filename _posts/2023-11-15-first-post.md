Happy new year! This is my first lab notebook entry. Since I am now
starting the second quarter of my graduate program, I will be
summarizing my research activities from the previous quarter.

### Drafting Protocol for Primary Cell Cultures

As I was unfamiliar with the practice of primary cell culturing I began
the process with reviewing basic cell culture techniques from the
textbook titled Culture of Animal Cells by R. Ian Freshney (5th
Edition). After, I began combing through the document "NSF proposal
grant references" in the Joint NSF Tunicate Google Drive to become up to
date with the latest methods in culturing *B. schlosseri* epithelial
cells. I found [*Epithelial cell cultures from Botryllus schlosseri
palleal buds: accomplishments and challenges*, 2003 by Rabinowitz &
Rinkevich](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11022-004-2087-9) particularly
useful. Collaborating with Valerie Dong from the UC Davis (UCD) lab, we
began adapting the Rabinowitz & Rinkevich 2003 methods into a standard
operating procedure that would become applicable to Aim 1 of the NSF
proposal, Optimization of primary cultures of *B. schlosseri*. This
protocol is still a work in progress and will need the addition of
methodologies for blood cell isolation.

### Visiting Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station

In November 2022 some members from the Gardell and [Kueltz](https://panoramaweb.org/Kueltz%20Lab%20-%20UCDavis/project-begin.view?) Labs visited
[Stanford's Tunicate Lab Hopkins Marine Station](https://marinestemcell.stanford.edu/) (HMS) for a two-day workshop
led by Dr. Ayelet Voskoboynik. This workshop covered a broad range of
topics such as: 
- General *B. schlosseri* anatomy and biology 
- Practice identifying the seven stages of cyclical asexual reproduction 
- Best practices in colony care and maintenance 
- Methods in dissection of whole zooids and embryos 
- Use of the [*B. schlosseri* Genome Project](http://botryllus.stanford.edu/botryllusgenome/) browser 
- Feedback regarding each labs respective methods and set-up

### Practicing the workflow of primary cell culturing

Prior to the conclusion of the Fall Quarter, I wanted to work through
the movements of primary cell isolation protocol Valerie, UCD, and I had
put together. This exercise was primarily intended to help me better
visualize the workflow and to get a better idea of the materials I
needed moving into the next quarter.

This process began with gathering a small number of colonies on which to
practice stage identification, maintenance, and zooid dissection. I
collected one bivalve covered in \~30 orange colonies from dock C9 and
another bivalve that had \~10 colonies on dock C10. The salinity in the
field was 29 PPT and the temperature was not measured.

Upon arriving to UWT, colonies were scraped off the bivalves with a new
razor and placed on 76.2 mm x 50.8 mm x 1.2 mm glass slides. I
subdivided the colonies so that there was only one "flower" per glass
slide. The glass slides were then placed on glass racks and placed
inside a plastic Tupperware that also contained a wet paper towel to
create a humidity chamber. The colonies were left for an hour. Only one
colony adhered to the glass slide, likely because it endured the least
mechanical stress as I did not subdivide since there weren't many
zooids in the tunic. The colonies that did not adhere were tied to the
glass slide with a cotton thread.

The colonies were transferred into the recirculating seawater system
immediately and were kept there for 3 days only being removed to take an
image of each colony under the microscope.

Overall, the colonies health seemed to be in decline over the course of
being kept in the recirculating seawater system as the number of zooids
per colony reduced. Regardless, at day 4, I took the colonies and
submerged them for 24 hours in a solution of Artificial Seawater and
Gentamycin (ASW-G) (Rabinowitz & Rinkevich 2003) to begin the initial
steps of cell isolation. The salinity of this solution was too high (75
PPT) as I misinterpreted the methods described (ASW needed at least a
1:1 dilution). After the 24 hour ASW-G treatment all 7 colonies exposed
no longer had visible blood circulation. Regardless, I practiced
dissecting out the zooids of the colonies using dissection pin needles.

The exercise was useful but will need to be redone with the correct
solutions to proceed into the following steps of the protocol.
