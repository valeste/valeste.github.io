Today I received a tutorial in making repo's and files in a terminal that can then be commited and pushed to GitHub in FISH 549. I attempted to do some of that work in the VS Code terminal but had trouble using the $ cd *insert_directory_name* function in the VS Code terminal to switch between directories. This command worked fine in the Mac Terminal app, however. I can manually switch between directories through this interface though so I don't think it should be a problem but I would like to find out why this is the case.

I also had another lab session to TA for today which went smoothly for my first solo session.
